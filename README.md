# COVID-19 Reddit Algo-Tracker

How do Reddit’s popularity algorithms promote information about COVID-19?

Since 2016, the [Citizens and Technology Lab](https://citizensandtech) (CAT Lab) has taken ongoing snapshots of reddit’s algorithms every 2-3 minutes. We created a dashboard, the [COVID-19 Reddit Algo-Tracker](https://covid-algotracker.citizensandtech.org/) to inform the design of our collaborations with reddit communities on COVID-19 public health research.
